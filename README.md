# Horiseon Remake 

## Description
This website's HTML and CSS now has streamlined  code and the coder reader can now more clearly identify what each section is controlling. The simplifed code reduced the content down quite signifcantly and has removed alot of unnecessary written and duplicated code instructions. I learnt that a div is too basic of a html element and it is prefered that code be written with semantic html elements.
